# 🎓 Ensemble Learning & Random Forests - Quick Revision Guide

---

## 1. What is Ensemble Learning?

**🟢 Simple Definition:**
Training multiple base learners (models) that are as different as possible and combining them smartly.

**🟢 Real-World Analogy:**
Like asking multiple doctors for their opinion and then taking the majority vote for a diagnosis — usually more reliable than trusting just one doctor.

### 🔍 Why Does It Work?

* **Wisdom of Crowds**: Multiple diverse opinions often beat individual experts
* **Error Cancellation**: Individual model mistakes tend to cancel each other out
* **Robustness**: Less likely to fail completely than single models

---

## 2. What is Bagging?

**Bagging = Bootstrap + Aggregation**

### 🧪 Bootstrap Step

**Bootstrapping** = Randomly creating samples of data **with replacement**

Think of it like:

* Bag with 1000 colored balls
* Randomly pick 1000 balls with replacement
* You get a different mix each time
* Repeat multiple times to create different datasets

### ⚖️ Aggregation Step

**Aggregation** = Combine predictions of each model

* **For Classification**: Use majority vote
* **For Regression**: Use mean or median of predictions

---

## 3. What are Random Forests?

**Random Forests** = Bagging ensemble with **Decision Trees** as base learners

### 🤖 Simple Analogy

A team of decision-makers, each trained on different data and features, combine their opinions for a better final decision.

### 🧱 Building Blocks of Random Forests

#### Step 1: Bootstrap Sampling

* Sample `m` points (usually `m = n`) **with replacement**
* Create `K` datasets this way

#### Step 2: Train `K` Decision Trees

* Each tree sees different data
* Trained independently and in parallel

#### Step 3: Use Out-of-Bag (OOB) samples for validation

* \~37% of data is unused per tree
* Gives "free" validation

#### Step 4: Aggregation

* **Classification**: Majority vote
* **Regression**: Mean or median

### 🎲 Sources of Randomness

#### 1. Row Sampling (Bootstrap Sampling)

* Random subset of rows per tree
* Each tree sees \~63% unique data

#### 2. Column Sampling (Feature Sampling)

* Random subset of features at each node split
* Prevents feature dominance

Typical values:

* Classification: `√(total features)`
* Regression: `(total features) ÷ 3`

#### 3. Depth Tuning

| Tree Depth     | Pros                  | Cons                       |
| -------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Shallow (3–5)  | Simple patterns, fast | May miss complexity        |
| Medium (10–15) | Balanced              | Good for most problems     |
| Deep (20+)     | Complex patterns      | Risk overfitting, slower   |
| Unlimited      | Pure nodes            | Very high overfitting risk |

All randomness types help:

* Row sampling: Diverse data
* Column sampling: Diverse features
* Depth tuning: Controls complexity

---

## 4. Out-of-Bag (OOB) Validation

### 💡 What are OOB Samples?

Samples **not selected** during bootstrapping (\~37% of data)

### 🔍 How to Use

* Use OOB samples to validate each tree
* Prediction for a sample = average prediction from trees that **didn't** see it
* **OOB Score** = Accuracy on OOB predictions

✅ Advantage: No separate validation set needed

---

## 5. Bias-Variance Tradeoff in Random Forests

### 📘 Formula

```
Error = Bias² + Variance + Irreducible Error
```

### 🧠 Bias

Bias occurs if:

* Trees are too shallow
* Algorithm is underfit
* Too few trees

### 🌪️ Variance

* More trees → lower variance
* But returns diminish after a point
* **Random Forests reduce variance, not bias**

### 🧪 Finding the Sweet Spot

Tune:

* Number of trees
* Tree depth
* Row/column sampling sizes

---

## 6. How Does Bagging Reduce Error?

### 🎩 The Magic

**Bootstrap Sampling**: Creates diverse models
**Aggregation**: Combines them, cancels out individual errors

### 📉 Why Error Decreases

* **Variance Reduction**: Main benefit
* **Bias Constant**: Mostly unchanged
* ✅ **Total Error Drops**: Due to reduced variance

---

## 7. Feature Importance in Random Forests

### 📊 How It's Calculated

1. Measure feature importance in each tree (Gini/Info Gain)
2. Average over all trees

> If a feature isn't selected in a tree, its importance = 0
> Naturally filters out unimportant features

---

## 8. Training Random Forests

### ⚙️ Parallel Training

* Trees trained **independently**
* No communication needed
* ✅ Easily parallelized

### ⏱️ Time Complexity

```
O(k × max_depth)
```

Where `k` = number of trees

---

## 9. Grid Search vs Random Search

### 🔍 Grid Search

**What It Does**: Exhaustive search over all param combinations

**✅ Pros**:

* Thorough
* Guaranteed to find best combo (within grid)

**❌ Cons**:

* Very slow for large grids
* Computationally heavy

### 🎲 Random Search

**What It Does**: Randomly samples combinations

**✅ Pros**:

* Fast
* Efficient for high-dimensional spaces
* Can stop anytime

**❌ Cons**:

* Might miss optimal settings
* Not exhaustive

### 🤔 When to Use?

* **Grid Search**: Small search space
* **Random Search**: Large or high-dimensional space

## 10. Key Hyperparameters in Random Forests

| Parameter           | What It Does                       | Typical Values           |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `n_estimators`      | Number of trees                    | 50, 100, 200, 500        |
| `max_depth`         | Tree depth                         | 5, 10, 15, 20, None      |
| `min_samples_split` | Min samples to split a node        | 2, 10, 20                |
| `min_samples_leaf`  | Min samples per leaf node          | 1, 5, 10                 |
| `max_features`      | Features considered for best split | `'sqrt'`, `'log2'`, None |

### 🧪 Quick Tuning Tips

* **Start Simple**: Use defaults
* **Increase Trees First**
* **Use `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`** to avoid overfitting
* **Use OOB Score** instead of a validation split
